    "The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37$^{\\circ}$C or 98.6$^{\\circ}$F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?"

    "<p>In this exercise, you will analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Answer the following questions <b>in this notebook below and submit to your Github account</b>.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>  Is the distribution of body temperatures normal? \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Although this is not a requirement for the Central Limit Theorem to hold (read the introduction on Wikipedia's page about the CLT carefully: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), it gives us some peace of mind that the population may also be normally distributed if we assume that this sample is representative of the population.\n",
    "    <li> Think about the way you're going to check for the normality of the distribution. Graphical methods are usually used first, but there are also other ways: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Remember that this is a condition for the Central Limit Theorem, and hence the statistical tests we are using, to apply.\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> First, try a bootstrap hypothesis test.\n",
    "    <li> Now, let's try frequentist statistical testing. Would you use a one-sample or two-sample test? Why?\n",
    "    <li> In this situation, is it appropriate to use the $t$ or $z$ statistic? \n",
    "    <li> Now try using the other test. How is the result be different? Why?\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Draw a small sample of size 10 from the data and repeat both frequentist tests. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Which one is the correct one to use? \n",
    "    <li> What do you notice? What does this tell you about the difference in application of the $t$ and $z$ statistic?\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be \"abnormal\"?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> As in the previous example, try calculating everything using the boostrap approach, as well as the frequentist approach.\n",
    "    <li> Start by computing the margin of error and confidence interval. When calculating the confidence interval, keep in mind that you should use the appropriate formula for one draw, and not N draws.\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>  Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> What testing approach did you use and why?\n",
    "    <li> Write a story with your conclusion in the context of the original problem.\n",
